The Dropwizard Metrics Graphite plugin provides capabilities for metrics reporting through Graphite
for Grails 4 applications.

Dropwizard dependencies used in this plugin:
```
io.dropwizard.metrics:metrics-core:4.1.5
io.dropwizard.metrics:metrics-graphite:4.1.5
```

Note: You may find you need to declare the Dropwizard dependencies as primary dependencies in
your build file because of the way Gradle 5 is handling Grails plugin dependencies.
