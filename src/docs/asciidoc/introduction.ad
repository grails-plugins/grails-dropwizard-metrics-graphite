The Dropwizard Metrics Graphite plugin provides capabilities for metrics reporting through Graphite
for Grails 3 applications.

It depends on the core Dropwizard Metrics plugin. (See the docs at http://grails-plugins.github.io/grails-dropwizard-metrics/)

Also, the Dropwizard GraphiteReporter requires JDK 8.
