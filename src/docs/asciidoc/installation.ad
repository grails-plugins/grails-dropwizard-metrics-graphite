To add the Dropwizard Metrics Graphite plugin to an application, add the following dependency to the
dependencies block of your build.gradle:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
compile "org.grails.plugins:dropwizard-metrics-graphite:{version}"

This plugin depends on version 1.0.0.M3+ of the core Dropwizard Metrics plugin, so you will also need
to declare the following dependency:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
compile "org.grails.plugins:dropwizard-metrics-:{version}"
